- Let's get Lost then! Just a short walk from Vauxhall Station situated on top of the market hall. You will not notice this place unless you know. You walk into food and retail markets, and then right at the back you stumble on some metal stairs that lead you to this florist bar. Best thing about this place at Lost, are the seasonal and classic Latin American cocktails!{topic=lost}

- The Vine Bar is an absolute gem 🦪 hidden behind Vauxhall station. A must try. Amazing selection of wines and whisky - if you are into that. 😏{topic=vine_bar}

- When you are in the Rookery Gardens it's almost like you're not in London. Head up the hill of Streatham Common and head off to the right to find The Rookery. The main garden has ornamental planting and a water feature around some specimen trees. Keep walking through and you'll find fields of long grass and hardly anyone else. Great place for a picnic!{topic=rookery}

- The Vauxhall centre is a really great and totally independent bouldering gym with a large variety of routes and very friendly staff – so if this is your first time climbing, they are always there for you! It is filled with a wide range of walls to climb (for beginners to experienced climbers), they also have indoor bike storage (for me) and a small cafe to boost up!{topic=climbing}

- The Black Cap 🫖 is just a couple of minutes riding from the Battersea Power station, you can find this very cute and cozy coffee shop – a hidden gem! It’s a really underrated place for a quality boost! Absolutely love the protein power station variety and their pancakes (super crispy & fluffy).

- The Travel Café - Serene, relaxed and cosy, trust me – the best cafe in the area. Just go, order a coffee, and simply sit on your own for twenty minutes to drink it. With orchestral music in the background and surrounded by plants, it's a great escape from the outside. This isn't a hipster trap, it's a very human and easy space to spend a time. Oh and on the plant note, they're very knowledgeable and it's a great place to procure that plant you need for your bedroom.{topic=travel_cafe}

 - The Leake Street Tunnel is a short walk away from Waterloo Station. It takes about five minutes to walk it from the station via York Road. Alternatively, you can access the tunnel from Lower Marsh Street – a cool little street with loads of cute independent shops, restaurants and cafes. Lower Marsh Street also has a weekday street food market that turns into a handmade and flea market on a Saturday. Enjoy! 🌞

- The Barbican Conservatory 🥦 is one of my favourite places to hang out in London! It's widely accessible, and many bike stands outside. An absolute gem with beautiful plants and art installations. It’s full of colour and animals, very humid inside which makes you think you’re entering another world and with its brutalist architecture it feels like that world is the abandoned Jurassic park. 😗{topic=barbican}

- Wilston's Music Hall 🪗 is a beautiful old music hall tucked away in the East End of London. It’s only been partially restored but is still amazing! It’s full of quirky old staircases and the entrance door is a masterpiece – wanna check it out?{topic=wilston}
