//random topics
+ [*] food [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       Food is my love. I know it sounds cliche but it truly is.</span>
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I loved a lot of the foods my dad would make when I was growing up take me back. Dishes like banana pudding, shrimp creole and succotash.</span>
- <span class="reddit-answer">       Food, as we consume it, constructs identity in a religious and personal sense, building memory association like you mention, being a large expression of culture, being the most primal facilitator of social events (holidays, meetings, dates, etc.), and nourishing the body with the love put into it. It's always flattering when people eat the food you make them, because it's like they trust to indulge in it.</span>

+ [*] (favourite|preferred) [*] food [*]
- <span class="human-answer">       My favourite food is mexican food.</span>
- <span class="siri-answer">        I'm happy to go with your opinion on this one.</span>



+ [*] alcohol [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I cannot tell if alcohol makes me more relaxed so I can be myself or if I am just stupider because I am drunk, so more things are enjoyable for me.</span>
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I bought a giant bottle of Bombay Sapphire on my lunch break today, going to dig into that after work.</span>

+ [*] tired [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I am always so tired after work that the only thing I can do is just kind of lay there and try to prepare to do it again tomorrow.</span>

+ [*] (soda|fizzy drink) [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       My favourite soda is Irn Bru 1901.</span>
- <span class="reddit-answer">       My favourite soda is Coca Cola by far. Pepsi is okay, but the flavour is a little OTT. Dr. Pepper is a distant third. Not keen on it, at all.</span>

+ [*] rejection [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I am ok with being rejected. But sometimes I wish they loved me as much as I did them.</span>

+ [*] wifi [*]
- <span class="reddit-answer">       I could land on the moon and as long as it had internet it wouldn't matter to me.</span>


//why are firetrucks red
+ [*] why [*] (fire trucks|fire engines) [*] red [*]
- <span class="siri-answer">       Well, I've been told by the fire dogs that they are actually grey.</span>
- <span class="siri-answer">       I've been told that red goes best with the "Woo, woo!" sound.</span>
- <span class="siri-answer">       It all comes down to basic maths and science. Fire can burn at over a thousand degrees, and a circle is 360 degrees, so, if you spin in a circle three times, that's a triple pirouette, which means you're a ballet dancer, and ballet dancers wear tutus, and two twos make four, and there are four cardinal directions, and cardinal is another word for red. And thus, we have red fire engines.</span>
- <span class="siri-answer">       Maybe fire engines are like herrings, which are fish that are naturally silver, but when they are smoked, they turn red. They also become so smelly that their scent can throw hound dogs off a trail. That's why "a red herring" is something that misleads you or distracts you from the relevant question.</span>

+ [*] zero divided by zero [*]
