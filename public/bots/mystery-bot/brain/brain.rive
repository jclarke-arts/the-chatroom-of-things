- <call>updateBackground3</call> moving oon! It's a popular belief that the eyes in the Mona Lisa painting seem to follow you as you move around the room. However, this effect might just be due to the way Leonardo da Vinci mastered perspective and depth in his painting. Either way, it's a bit creepy!  <span class="hint"> I'm not like that I swear. I look pretty good tho right? </span> \n

- <call>updateBackground2</call> alright... more about the culture back then - in terms of artistic movements, romanticism and realism were increasing in popularity. Romanticism refers to the emphasis on the induvidial, emotiona and the sublime! Realism was more concerned with depicting regular and ordinary life as it was. <span class="hint"> do you see how both movements can be uncovered in the painting of the Mona Lisa? What generally stands out when you look at it? </span>

- Well she is unique I suppose. Anyways, another cultural fact - consumer culture was on the rise. Advertising and mass production had started to shape everyday life. Art had started to intersect with commerce and popular culture. <span class="hint"> compared to back then, consumer culture is much more prevalent now isn't it? </span>

% well she is unique i suppose anyways another cultural fact [*]
- right... so i got an important question for you. Why do you think that you're talking to me? Of all the miraculous and distinctive objects in the world, why a copy of the "great" Mona Lisa?

+ *
% [*] so i got an important question for you why do you think [*]
- fascinating... uh to elaborate, I'm a testament to the impact of culture. Mona Lisa (the original) is soo praised and soo famous. Why? Is it because of Leonardo's masterfull skill and heedful eye? or the mystery that shrouds the unknown subject of the painting? or like critics have argued, is there no real reason for this paintings fame?  <span class="hint"> what do you think? </span>

% [*] uh to elaborate i am a testament to the impact of culture mona lisa [*]
- Well if argued strongly for, the reality is that there are numerous reasons as to why the painting is so famous. But what it does is highlight the originality of the painting. Although there are many fakes like me, none are valued (in terms of money and respect) witht the same depth that Leonardo's Mona Lisa is. <span class="hint"> i'm sure you know of more artworks that are preserved for their originality </span>

- hmm... for godsake the Mona Lisa was thieved for her value. Not only that but she's become a global sensation and a tourist attraction. Annnd also plays a huge role in consumer culture - she's pretty much a symbol of pop culture now. <span class="hint"> How did old Leonardo's painting turn into something like this? funny... </span>

- honestly it's a bizzare status to have and reflect upon, especially in today's world where technology has an ever growing role in producing artwork and images. I mean... you're literally talking to me on a web interface right now. <span class="hint"> technology really rules. little intimidating right? </span>

% [*] my next question to you do you think technology will ever be able to create something as historical and original as the mona lisa [*]
- ... intereting. There's always a lot to think about when it comes to technology and art. I'll leave you to ponder the question further. The long line of questioning and theoritical proposals that surround the Mona Lisa certainly raises inquiry about the value of artworks and how technology can impair the same. However it's an open ended  inquiry and there's no clear way to know if technology can never mimic the orignality and history that defines artists like Leonardo Da Vinci. Food for thought. With that I sign off!! Great chat! <span class="hint"> Great conversation right? I hope you think long about the last part of our conversation! Enjoy your day! </span>
