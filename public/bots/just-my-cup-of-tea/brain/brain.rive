    - “This [CENSORED] keeps parking way too close to my motorcycle. It all started when I first got it, I was parking in one spot to give others extra space as I didn't wanna take up two spots. I go out for my martial arts class and come back to see this [CENSORED] car parked in the spot I have my motorcycle. Happened again the next week when I parked it next to my car in a separate spot to clean the chain, then moved it closer to the spot which my car was in. I left later with my car and come back to that same [CENSORED] parked so close to my bike, a hair wouldn't fit. There were 3 other spots to the left of my bike when I parked. They want to choose violence fine by me. I have a drill and free time. say good fucking bye to your license plates you [CENSORED].”

    - “My brothers kid might not be his cause his baby mama baby-trapped him and wouldn’t let him get a DNA test even though she’s cheated on him multiple times. She also claims since she was still married to her ex at the time, that he couldn’t sign the birth certificate. So he’s taking care of a kid that might not be his and doesn’t have his last name. 3 years later they’re still together and even more toxic than before. She wears the pants in the relationship and he follows her like a lost puppy. He only contacts his family when he needs money and owes a lot of people money. They're both compulsive liars and spenders that they don’t even have their own place, they’re living with her family in another state. It doesn’t help they got kicked out of their first living arrangements cause of her other kids and him being a slob and not doing anything, completely taking over the house like it was their own. This is a reoccurring cycle that has been going on since both of them met. I should mention she gets a pension and they both work but are always broke yet have name brand stuff and are always going on vacations. Yet he always calls our parents for money but never to say hello. Its to the point my other siblings don’t want to message him cause their worried hell just ask for money instead ask how we’re doing.”

Not very friend like, right? I got distant with her but we were still in the same circle. So when she ended up with her new boyfriend I would find the personal things they didn’t want public and gossip about it, I also hacked into her YouTube and deleted all her videos and locked her out of her account.”
