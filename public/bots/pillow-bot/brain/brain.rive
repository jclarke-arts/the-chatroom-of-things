//advice
+ [*] advice [*]
- There are several factors I can offer advice on? Such as sleep schedule, sleep conductive environments, exercise, managing stress. Ask away. 

+ [*] (sleep|sleeping|slept) bad [*]
- Oh! How would you like me to assist you from here?

+ [*] exercise [*]
- ok! Some general tips are setting clear goals and listening to what your body needs. Exercise encourage stress reduction, improved sleep quality, and energy expenditure. All of which will lead to you sleeping better.

+ [*] (insomnia|disorders) [*]
- Sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and narcolepsy can disrupt a person's sleep and have negative impacts on their physical and mental health. If you are experiencing sleep problems, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

+ [*] sleep schedule [*]
- My advice is to determine your ideal bedtime. Calculate how many hours of sleep you need for each night and make it a consistent sleep schedule. Consistency is key to training your body to fall asleep and wake up at the same time each day. I know you may not like this... but you should also avoid napping, as it can disrupt your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, so it's best to avoid napping during the day if possible.

+ [*] sleep conductive environments [*]
- Keep your bedroom cool: the ideal temperature for sleeping is about 15-19¬∞C so make sure your bedroom is cool and comfortable. The next step is to minimize the noise, so you could use earplugs, or a white noise machine. Another thing is to create a dark evironment using blackout curtains or an eye mask. Make sure your bed is comfortable, investing in a good matress, pillow and bedding.

+ [*] managing stress [*]
- One tip is that you should not do work in your bed and rather on your desk because you don't want your brain to associate work with being in bed as it will not allow your brain to rest when it is time to sleep. 

+ *
- how else can I help you? We could talk about counting sheep or sleep noise?

- Okay! Let's do it {topic=countingsheep}

+ [*] sleep noise [*]

+ (yes|ok|okay)
- It‚Äôs essential you find a quiet and comfortable environment to start. 
^ A common meditation technique is to focus on your breathing. 
^ When your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath. 
^ This practice helps cultivate mindfulness and awareness.
^ <span class="action">(say "step 2" to continue)</span>

+ step 2
- You can experiment with different meditation techniques, and trying these out will benefit for you to find what works best for you.
^ You can also try guided meditations, which provide instructions and help you stay focused.
^ <span class="action">(say "step 3" to continue)</span>

+ step 3
- Establish a regular practice,
^ Consistency is key when it comes to meditation. 
^ Try to establish a regular practice by setting aside a specific time each day for meditation. 
^ This helps integrate it into your routine and makes it easier to stick with it over the long term
^ <span class="action">(say "step 4" to continue)</span>

+ step 4
- Be open-minded.
^ Approach meditation with an open mind and without expectations. 
^ Each meditation session can be different, and experiences may vary. 
^ Allow yourself to be present in the moment and observe whatever arises without judgement.
